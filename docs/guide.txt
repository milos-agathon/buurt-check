Run PowerShell as Administrator to register or update all scheduled tasks:

powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\compound\register-tasks.ps1 -ProjectPath "D:\buurt-check" -PowerShellExe "powershell.exe"

Verify tasks:

Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object { $_.TaskName -like "Compound-*" }

A) Manual prompts in Claude Code (right now)

1) Open a terminal in D:\buurt-check.
2) Run Claude Code with a prompt:

claude -p "Read CLAUDE.md and prd.md. Suggest next 3 concrete tasks for this repo."

3) If you want it to do work, be explicit:

claude -p "Read CLAUDE.md and prd.md. Pick one small task and implement it. Run any relevant checks and report results."

If Claude Code asks for permissions, you can pass:

--dangerously-skip-permissions

(Only do this if you trust the repo and the prompt.)

B) How your nightly loop uses prompts (automatic)

1) Daily compound review
   scripts\compound\daily-compound-review.ps1 runs:
   - checks out main, pulls
   - runs Claude Code to review threads and update CLAUDE.md

2) Auto-compound
   scripts\compound\auto-compound.ps1 runs:
   - reads newest report in reports\
   - prompts Claude Code to write a PRD in tasks\
   - prompts Claude Code to generate tasks in scripts\compound\prd.json
   - loops and prompts Claude Code to implement tasks

So when the scheduled tasks run, Claude Code is prompted automatically by these scripts.

C) Run the loop manually (no scheduler)

powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\compound\auto-compound.ps1 -ProjectPath "D:\buurt-check"

---

D) What you need for Claude Code to work

Required:
- Node.js
- Claude Code (npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code)

Claude Max note:
- No API key needed. .env.local is only for optional tokens (e.g., GITHUB_TOKEN).

Optional (for PR creation):
- GitHub CLI (gh) authenticated (gh auth login)

Optional (recommended):
- PowerShell 7 (pwsh). If not installed, scripts run under Windows PowerShell 5.1.

If your PowerShell profile causes errors, use -NoProfile when running scripts.

E) Scheduled task times (default)

- 5:00 PM -- Prevent sleep
- 10:30 PM -- Daily review prompt
- 11:00 PM -- Full auto-compound prompt loop

---

F) Quick status check

powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\compound\status.ps1
